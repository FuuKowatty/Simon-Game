# Simon-Game Project
Design is inspired by some photos in google-grapics but all code is my job. Firsly it draw a combination next bot would be do sequence accords to this combination.
Next is your turn to imitate AI sequence. If you do it correctly score will increment and next round will be harder cause a quanity of combinations depends on
your score. Core technology is there setInterval, setTimeout and eventlisteners which means good knwoledge about asynchronous is important there.
GL HF!
THAT SITE IS NOT FINAL PROJECT
